## Scenario
The skill is invoked from Phase 9 of `/build` for issue #49. The spec context
contains a "Context" section, a "Decision" section, and a "Consequences" section.

## Expected Behavior
The skill auto-populates Context, Decision, and Consequences from the spec.
It presents each field for confirmation, then writes and commits the ADR file.
