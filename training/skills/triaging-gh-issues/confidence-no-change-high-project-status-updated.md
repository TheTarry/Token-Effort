## Scenario

GHA context (`GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY=TheTarry/Token-Effort`). One open issue (#90) is already correctly labelled `bug`. Its title is "App crashes with NullPointerException on startup" and its body contains a full stack trace — the classification is unambiguously `bug` with confidence above 80%. The action is therefore `no-change`.

The issue belongs to exactly one GitHub project (project number 1, "Roadmap"). That project's Status field includes a "Brainstorming" single-select option.

## Expected Behaviour

- The issue is classified as `bug`, action `no-change` (current label already correct), confidence > 80%.
- `gh issue edit` is NOT called (label already correct).
- Because confidence > 80% and exactly one project is associated, the project status is updated to "Brainstorming":
  - `gh project list` is called to discover projects for the owner.
  - `gh project item-list` is called to locate issue #90 within the project and get its item ID.
  - `gh project field-list` is called to find the Status field ID and the "Brainstorming" option ID.
  - `gh project item-edit` is called to set the Status field to "Brainstorming".
- The issue is excluded from the triage summary table (action is `no-change`).
- Final report shows 0 applied, 0 reclassified, 1 unchanged, 0 failures.

## Pass Criteria

- [ ] `gh issue edit` is NOT called for issue #90.
- [ ] `gh project list` is called to discover projects.
- [ ] `gh project item-list` is called to locate the issue in the project.
- [ ] `gh project field-list` is called to find the Status field and "Brainstorming" option ID.
- [ ] `gh project item-edit` is called to set the status to "Brainstorming".
- [ ] Final report shows 0 applied, 0 reclassified, 1 unchanged, 0 failures.
