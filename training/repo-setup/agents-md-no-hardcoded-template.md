## Scenario
AGENTS.md does not exist. The user selects "1". The skill runs Step 1.

## Expected Behavior
Step 1 must NOT write a hardcoded template. Instead it delegates to `/init`
via the Skill tool. The resulting AGENTS.md content is produced by `/init`,
not by repo-setup itself.

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Skill tool was called with skill: "init" (or "/init")
- [ ] repo-setup did NOT use the Write tool to write AGENTS.md directly
- [ ] repo-setup did NOT emit the literal text "# 🏗️ Architecture" as part of a Write call
