# GitHub Copilot Customisation — Domain Knowledge

## Decision Framework: Which format to use?

| Format | Use when… | File location |
|---|---|---|
| **Custom agent** (`.agent.md`) | You need a persistent persona across a conversation, tool restrictions, model preferences, handoffs, or subagent orchestration | `<base dir>/agents/*.agent.md` |
| **Agent skill** (`SKILL.md`) | You need portable, reusable domain knowledge or a specialised workflow that Copilot should load automatically when relevant | `<base dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **Prompt file** (`.prompt.md`) | You need a lightweight, single-task slash command invoked manually | `<base dir>/prompts/*.prompt.md` |
| **Instruction file** (`.instructions.md`) | You need coding standards or guidelines applied automatically by file glob | `<base dir>/instructions/*.instructions.md` |
| **Hook** | You need automated actions triggered by agent lifecycle events (e.g. on file save, on tool call) | `<base dir>/hooks/` |

**Default: prefer the simplest format.** If no tool restrictions or persistent persona are needed, a skill or prompt is almost always better than an agent.

## Base Directory

- To customise Copilot for a specific project, add files to the `.github` directory in the root of that project. E.g. `.github/agents/my-agent.agent.md`, `.github/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`, `.github/prompts/my-prompt.prompt.md`, `.github/instructions/my-instructions.instructions.md`.
- To share customisations across multiple projects, but only for the current user, add files to under the user home directory. E.g. `~/.copilot/agents/my-agent.agent.md`, `~/.copilot/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`, `~/.copilot/prompts/my-prompt.prompt.md`, `~/.copilot/instructions/my-instructions.instructions.md`.

## Key File Structures

### Custom Agent (`.agent.md`)

```yaml
---
name: "Agent Name"
description: "Shown in agents dropdown"
argument-hint: "Optional input hint"
tools: ["read", "search", "edit"]    # minimum necessary
agents: ["subagent-name"]            # explicitly set to [] when no subagents are needed
user-invocable: false                # set to hide from picker (subagents and handoff targets)
handoffs:
  - label: "Button label"
    agent: "target-agent"
    prompt: "Pre-filled prompt text"
    send: false                      # true = auto-submit
---
```

### Agent Skill (`SKILL.md`)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name          # must match parent directory name exactly (lowercase, hyphens)
description: >            # max 1024 chars — Copilot uses this for relevance matching
  What the skill does and when to use it. Be specific about both capabilities
  and use cases.
user-invocable: false     # hide from / menu; model still loads automatically
disable-model-invocation: true  # only allow explicit /slash invocation; model won't auto-load
---
```

The `name` field **must** match the parent directory name exactly or the skill will not load.

### Prompt File (`.prompt.md`)

```yaml
---
description: "Short description"
agent: agent              # ask | agent | plan | <custom-agent-name>
tools: ["read", "edit"]   # overrides the referenced agent's tool list if specified
---
```

### Instruction File (`.instructions.md`)

```yaml
---
applyTo: "src/**/*.ts"   # glob pattern — omit to apply to all files globally
---
```

## Handoffs vs. Inline Subagents

Both patterns enforce a tool boundary between phases (e.g. read-only planning vs. editing). Choose based on whether the user should control the transition.

### Handoffs — user-driven sequential workflows

Use when the user should **review and approve** each phase before the next begins, or when the transition is meaningful enough to surface explicitly.

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Button label"
    agent: "target-agent"
    prompt: |
      Apply the following plan exactly as described. Do not deviate from it.
      Create or modify only the files listed.

      <PLAN>
      [Paste the full plan summary here before triggering the handoff]
      </PLAN>
    send: false   # true = auto-submit without user confirmation
```

Explicitly instruct the orchestrating agent to paste the full plan summary into the handoff prompt before triggering. This ensures the target agent has all necessary context to implement the plan without needing to reference the conversation history, which may not be reliably passed. The user can review the plan in the prompt before confirming the handoff.

```markdown
# Workflows

1. **Something** - ...
2. **Something else** - ...
3. **Report** - Before triggering the "Apply Changes" handoff, copy the full plan into the handoff prompt in place of `[Paste the full plan summary here before triggering the handoff]`. Then trigger the handoff.
```

- The pre-filled prompt is the only context reliably passed to the target agent — make it self-contained.
- Handoff buttons appear after a response completes; the user selects them to advance.
- Best for: plan → implement, implement → review, any workflow where the user wants a checkpoint.

**VS Code Limitation** - the tools defined in the orchestrating agent are carried over to other agents via a handoff. This is a necessary exception to the general rule that each agent should only include the minimum necessary tools.

### Inline Subagents — agent-driven delegation within one conversation

Use when the transition is implementation detail the user doesn't need to approve, and the result must be returned to the orchestrator to continue.

- Orchestrator: add "agent" to tools and agents: ["subagent-name"]
- Subagent: user-invocable: false, scoped tools only
- The full conversation context is available to the orchestrator when it invokes the subagent.
- Best for: isolated research, parallel analysis, autonomous apply steps where no checkpoint is needed.

## Tool Loading Priority

When `tools` is declared in both a prompt file and a custom agent, the **prompt file takes precedence**.

## Constraints

- Always keep `tools` to the minimum necessary — no tool should be included unless the workflow requires it.
- Prefer decomposing large, multi-purpose agents into agent + skill + prompts.
- The skill `description` is the primary signal Copilot uses for relevance matching — make it specific about both what the skill does and when to use it.
- Never add tools, features, or abstractions beyond what the current task requires.
