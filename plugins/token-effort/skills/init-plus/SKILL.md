# Init Plus

## Overview
Presents a numbered menu of six repo setup steps. The user selects which steps to run (by number or "all"), and the skill executes them in fixed order 1→6. Each step handles overwrite detection and asks before replacing existing files.

**Usage:** `/token-effort:init-plus`

Step 5 (Dependabot) is delegated entirely to `token-effort:configuring-dependabot`.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- Setting up a new repository with standard project infrastructure
- Adding one or more standard files to an existing repository

**Do not use when:**
- You only want to configure Dependabot — run `/token-effort:configuring-dependabot` directly instead

## Prerequisites
<!-- The version tag in the github-setup.md URLs below is updated automatically by release.yml at publish time. Do not change it manually. -->
- For Step 3: a GitHub App and project board must be configured — see [docs/github-setup.md](https://github.com/HeadlessTarry/Token-Effort/blob/v0.6.1/docs/github-setup.md)
- For Step 5: the `token-effort:configuring-dependabot` skill must be installed

## Process
### Phase 1 — Repo scan & menu presentation
Scan the repository using Glob to detect which artefacts already exist:

| Step | File/path to check |
|---|---|
| 1. CLAUDE.md | `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) |
| 2. Superpowers plugin | Cannot be verified locally — always show `[not verified]` |
| 3. Triage workflow | `.github/workflows/triaging-gh-issues.yml` |
| 4. Issue templates | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (any file in this directory) |
| 5. Dependabot | `.github/dependabot.yml` |
| 6. Bootstrap `/verify` skill | `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md` |

Present the following menu, substituting the correct status annotation for each item:
```
Select which setup steps to run (e.g. "1 3 5" or "all"):

1. Generate CLAUDE.md                         [<status>]
2. Recommend superpowers plugin               [not verified]
3. Create auto-triage GitHub Actions workflow [<status>]
4. Create GitHub issue templates              [<status>]
5. Configure Dependabot                       [<status>]
6. Bootstrap `/verify` skill                  [<status>]
```

Status annotations:
- `[not present]` — file/dir does not exist
- `[exists — will overwrite]` — file/dir exists and would be replaced
- `[not verified]` — superpowers plugin only

Wait for the user to reply with space-separated numbers (e.g. `1 3`) or `all`. Parse the reply into a sorted list of step numbers. Always execute steps in ascending order 1→6 regardless of input order.
### Phase 2 — Execute selected steps
Execute only the steps the user selected, in order.

---
**Step 1 — CLAUDE.md**
If `CLAUDE.md` exists:

> "`CLAUDE.md` already exists. Overwrite? [yes/no]"
Wait for confirmation. If the user says no, note "CLAUDE.md: skipped (overwrite declined)" in the summary and move on.
Invoke `/init` via the Skill tool (`skill: "init"`) to generate `CLAUDE.md`. Do not write `CLAUDE.md` directly or use a hardcoded template — `/init` analyses the project and produces contextual content.

---
**Step 2 — Superpowers plugin**
Print:

> **Strongly recommended: Install the `superpowers` Claude plugin.**
>
> The `superpowers` plugin adds powerful skills for planning, TDD, debugging, and code review.
> Install from the Claude Code plugin marketplace, or visit: https://github.com/obra/superpowers

Ask:
> "Have you installed the superpowers plugin (or do you already have it)? [yes/no/skip]"
If the user says yes, note "Superpowers plugin: confirmed installed" in the summary.
If the user says no or skips, note "Superpowers plugin: not installed (recommended)" in the summary. Do not block.

---
**Step 3 — Auto-triage GitHub Actions workflow**
Print:

> "Step 3 requires a GitHub App and project board. See [docs/github-setup.md](https://github.com/HeadlessTarry/Token-Effort/blob/v0.6.1/docs/github-setup.md) for setup instructions."
Ask:
> "Is everything in [docs/github-setup.md](https://github.com/HeadlessTarry/Token-Effort/blob/v0.6.1/docs/github-setup.md) configured? [yes/no/skip]"

If the user says no or skips, print: "> Complete the setup in [docs/github-setup.md](https://github.com/HeadlessTarry/Token-Effort/blob/v0.6.1/docs/github-setup.md), then re-run `/token-effort:init-plus` and select Step 3 to continue." Note "Triage workflow: skipped (prerequisites not met)" in the summary and continue to Step 4.
If `.github/workflows/triaging-gh-issues.yml` exists:
> "`.github/workflows/triaging-gh-issues.yml` already exists. Overwrite? [yes/no]"

Wait for confirmation. If the user says no, note "Triage workflow: skipped (overwrite declined)" in the summary and continue.
Create directory `.github/workflows/` if it does not exist.
Write `.github/workflows/triaging-gh-issues.yml`:

```yaml

          # Always references the Token-Effort plugin source — correct even when deploying to other repos

            Use the `token-effort:triaging-gh-issues` skill with `--advance-status`.
            Triage all open issues in this repository.

            Upon completion, write a brief markdown summary of your activity to the GitHub Actions step summary using: SUMMARY_FILE=$(printenv GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY) && echo "**[Claude]** {Activity summary}" >> "$SUMMARY_FILE"
          claude_args: >-
            --model sonnet

```

---
**Step 4 — GitHub issue templates**
Check if any of the following files exist:
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-feature_request.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/02-bug_report.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`

If any exist:
> "One or more issue template files already exist. Overwrite all? [yes/no]"
Wait for confirmation. If the user says no, note "Issue templates: skipped (overwrite declined)" in the summary and continue.

Create directory `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` if it does not exist.
Write `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-feature_request.md`:
```markdown
---
name: Feature request
about: Suggest an idea for this project
title: ''
labels: enhancement
assignees: ''

---

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

assignees: ''

---

## Describe the bug

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

```
Write `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`:

```yaml
---
blank_issues_enabled: false
```
---

**Step 5 — Dependabot config**
Invoke: `token-effort:configuring-dependabot`
Do not perform any Dependabot logic directly. The sub-skill handles all scanning, overwrite detection, and file writing.

---
**Step 6 — Bootstrap `/verify` skill**
Check if `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md` already exists in the repository.

If it exists:
> "`/verify` skill already exists — skipping."
Note "`/verify`: skipped (already exists)" in the summary and continue.

Otherwise, ask:
> "What commands should be run to verify this project is working correctly? List them in the order they should run."
If the user says they don't know yet or wants to skip:

> "`/verify` not configured — run `/init-plus` again when you're ready to set this up."
Note "`/verify`: skipped (no commands provided)" in the summary and continue.
Otherwise, confirm the list back to the user:

> "I'll configure `/verify` with these commands in order:
> 1. `<command 1>`
> 2. `<command 2>`
> ...
> Is that correct? [yes/no]"

Wait for confirmation. If the user says no, re-ask for the command list.
Create directory `.claude/skills/verify/` if it does not exist.
Write `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`, substituting the confirmed commands for `<command N>`:

~~~markdown
---
name: verify
description: Use when asked to verify changes, run all checks, confirm everything
  is working, run tests, or check nothing is broken before committing
user-invocable: true
---

# Verify

Run all project checks to confirm changes are working correctly.

## Commands

Run each of the following commands. Report the result of each (pass/fail and any output).
If any command fails, stop and report the failure. Do not run any remaining commands.

1. `<command 1>`
2. `<command 2>`
(Add one line per additional command)
~~~

Note "`/verify`: created" in the summary.
### Phase 3 — Completion summary
Print a summary of all selected steps:

```
✅ Done. Here's what was set up:
- CLAUDE.md: created
- Superpowers plugin: confirmed installed
- Triage workflow: created
- Issue templates: created
- Dependabot: delegated to /configuring-dependabot
- /verify: created
```

Adjust each line to reflect the actual outcome (e.g. "created", "skipped (overwrite declined)", "skipped (prerequisites not met)", "not installed (recommended)"). Include only the steps the user selected — omit unselected steps from the summary entirely.
No git commit is made. The user decides what to commit.
## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping overwrite checks** — always warn and ask before writing any file that already exists.
- **Executing steps not selected by the user** — only run the steps the user chose.
- **Executing steps out of order** — always run in order 1→6 regardless of user input order.
- **Blocking on Step 3 prerequisites** — if the user says prerequisites are not set up, note it in the summary and continue. Do not halt the skill.
- **Blocking on Step 2 "no"** — if the user says the superpowers plugin is not installed, note it and continue. Do not halt.
- **Performing Dependabot logic directly in Step 5** — always delegate to `token-effort:configuring-dependabot`. Do not scan ecosystems or write `dependabot.yml` yourself.
- **Writing `CLAUDE.md` directly in Step 1** — always delegate to `/init` via the Skill tool. Do not write the file directly or use a hardcoded template.
- **Omitting skipped steps from the summary** — every selected step must appear in the summary, even if skipped or declined.
- **Writing `/verify` when it already exists** — always check for `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md` first. If it exists, skip with the log message and do not overwrite.
- **Not confirming commands before writing** — always echo the command list back to the user and wait for a yes confirmation before writing `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`.
- **Writing the file when the user skips** — if the user says they don't know or wants to skip, do not generate any file. Log the "not configured" message and move on.
