# 🏗️ Build a GitHub Issue

## 🌐 Overview

Implements a GitHub issue end-to-end: fetches the issue, its approved design spec, and its approved implementation plan, moves the issue to "Building" status, executes the plan, verifies and reviews the result, and opens a pull request. The pull request is created exactly once, at the final phase.

**Usage:** `/token-effort:building-gh-issue <issue-number>`

Strip any leading `#` from the issue number before use (e.g. `#42` → `42`).

## ⚙️ When to Use

**Use when:**
- A GitHub issue has both an approved design spec comment (produced by `token-effort:brainstorming-gh-issue`) and an approved implementation plan comment (produced by `token-effort:planning-gh-issue`) and is ready to be implemented
- You want a structured, end-to-end build workflow from plan to merged PR

**Do not use when:**
- The issue does not yet have a design spec comment — run `/token-effort:brainstorming-gh-issue <N>` first and get the spec approved
- The issue does not yet have an implementation plan comment — run `/token-effort:planning-gh-issue <N>` first and get the plan approved
- Implementation is already underway on a branch — join that branch directly instead

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI must be authenticated and available in the session. All GitHub operations use `gh` commands via `Bash`. No MCP tools are used or required.
- The issue must have a design spec comment whose body begins with `<!-- brainstorming-gh-issue:spec -->`, produced by `token-effort:brainstorming-gh-issue`.
- The issue must have an implementation plan comment whose body begins with `<!-- token-effort:planning-gh-issue -->`, produced by `token-effort:planning-gh-issue`.
- The following `superpowers` skills must be installed:
  - `superpowers:executing-plans`
  - `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`
  - `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`

> **Important:** Do **not** use MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_github_github__*`) for any issue or GitHub operation.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Fetch issue, extract spec and plan

Run:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,body,comments,labels
```

**Extract spec:** Search the `comments` array for a comment whose body starts with `<!-- brainstorming-gh-issue:spec -->`.

**If no spec comment is found:** Stop immediately with the error:

> "Issue #N does not have a design spec comment. Run `/token-effort:brainstorming-gh-issue <N>` to generate one, then get it approved before building."

**If found:** Extract the spec body — the full comment content **after** stripping the `<!-- brainstorming-gh-issue:spec -->` marker line.

**Extract plan:** Search the `comments` array for a comment whose body starts with `<!-- token-effort:planning-gh-issue -->`.

**If no plan comment is found:** Stop immediately with the error:

> "Issue #N does not have an implementation plan comment. Run `/token-effort:planning-gh-issue <N>` to generate one, then get it approved before building."

**If found:** Extract the plan body — the full comment content **after** stripping the `<!-- token-effort:planning-gh-issue -->` marker line. This is the plan used for execution in Phase 3.

### Phase 2 — Move issue to Building status

Invoke: `token-effort:move-issue-status <N> "Building"`

If this fails for any reason (e.g. the issue is not on a project board, or the skill is unavailable), **log a warning and continue**. This phase is non-fatal — do not block the build on a status update failure.

### Phase 3 — Execute plan

Assess the plan extracted in Phase 1. Choose the execution skill:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `superpowers:executing-plans` | **Default.** Use for most plans. |
| `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | Use **only** when ALL THREE of the following apply: (1) the plan has many independent tasks with no sequential dependencies between them, (2) changes span 5 or more separate subsystems/modules, and (3) the plan is explicitly scoped as large or complex. |

Invoke the chosen skill with the plan content injected as context, and the following **mandatory suppression instruction** included verbatim in the prompt:

> "Do not invoke `finishing-a-development-branch` — this will be handled by the calling skill after all review steps complete."

This instruction is required regardless of which execution skill is chosen. Do not paraphrase or omit it.

### Phase 4 — Verify (optional)

Attempt to invoke the project-local `/verify` skill.

If `/verify` is not available or not found, log the following named warning and continue:

> "⚠️ Phase 4 skipped: `/verify` skill not available in this project"

Do not block on this phase.

### Phase 5 — Inline simplify pass

Review all changed code directly using Claude's built-in reasoning. No separate skill invocation is needed.

Check for:
- Unnecessary duplication
- Opportunities to reuse existing utilities
- Over-engineering
- Efficiency issues

Fix any issues found directly. Report a brief summary of changes made, or "No changes needed" if nothing required fixing.

### Phase 6 — Code review

Invoke: `token-effort:reviewing-code-systematically`

Address any `BLOCK` or `NEEDS_CHANGES` findings before continuing to Phase 7.

### Phase 7 — Inline security review

Review all changed code directly using Claude's built-in reasoning. No separate skill invocation is needed.

Check for:
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure credential handling
- Exposed secrets
- Unsafe shell expansion
- OWASP Top 10 concerns relevant to the changes

Fix any issues found directly. Report a brief summary of findings, or "No security issues found" if the review was clean.

### Phase 8 — Record decisions

Invoke: `token-effort:recording-decisions`

If the skill is not available, **stop immediately** with:

> "❌ Phase 8 blocked: `token-effort:recording-decisions` skill is required but not available.
>  Install the skill before continuing the build."

Do not proceed to Phase 9 until this phase completes successfully.

### Phase 9 — Finish development branch

Invoke: `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`

This step creates the pull request. It runs exactly once, here, at the end of the build process. The execution skills in Phase 3 must not call it — that is what the suppression instruction in Phase 3 enforces.

## Common Mistakes

- **Blocking on Phase 2 failure** — `move-issue-status` errors are non-fatal. Log the warning and continue. Never stop the build because of a status update failure.
- **Proceeding without a plan comment** — if `<!-- token-effort:planning-gh-issue -->` is not found in the issue, abort immediately with the message to run `/token-effort:planning-gh-issue #N` first. Do not proceed to execution without an approved plan.
- **Omitting the suppression instruction from the Phase 3 prompt** — the verbatim instruction `"Do not invoke finishing-a-development-branch — this will be handled by the calling skill after all review steps complete."` must be included in the execution skill invocation. Paraphrasing it or omitting it is incorrect.
- **Calling `finishing-a-development-branch` inside the Phase 3 execution skill** — the PR creation step belongs at Phase 9 and only there. The suppression instruction in Phase 3 enforces this; do not override it.
- **Choosing `subagent-driven-development` for moderate-scope plans** — the default is `executing-plans`. Only switch to `subagent-driven-development` when all three conditions (independent tasks, 5+ subsystems, explicitly large/complex scope) are met simultaneously.
- **Silently skipping Phase 4** — Phase 4 is optional but must log a named warning when skipped. Do not silently continue without the warning.
- **Continuing past Phase 8 when `recording-decisions` is unavailable** — Phase 8 is a hard block. If the skill is not installed, stop with the error message. Do not warn and continue.
- **Passing the full raw comment body to the execution skill** — strip both the `<!-- brainstorming-gh-issue:spec -->` and `<!-- token-effort:planning-gh-issue -->` marker lines before using their content. Do not include markers in the context.
- **Not stripping the leading `#` from the issue number** — `gh issue view` requires a bare integer. Strip any `#` prefix before constructing the command.
- **Using MCP tools for issue operations** — all GitHub interactions must use `gh` CLI commands. Never call `mcp__plugin_github_github__*` tools for any operation.
- **Calling `finishing-a-development-branch` more than once** — it must be called exactly once, at Phase 9, regardless of how many execution iterations Phase 3 required.
