# Autoresearch: Iterative Skill/Agent Improvement

## Overview

Applies the Karpathy "autoresearch" pattern to skill and agent definitions. Instead of tweaking ML training code, it mutates `SKILL.md` / agent `.md` files and scores each candidate against committed eval cases. Run for a single cycle (manual) or many cycles (autonomous).

**Usage:** `/running-autoresearch <name>` or `/running-autoresearch agent:<name>`

## Phase 1 — Target

Resolve paths from the user's argument:

| Input | Definition file | Evals directory |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| `starting-git-branch` | `claude/skills/starting-git-branch/SKILL.md` | `training/skills/starting-git-branch/` |
| `agent:reviewer-docs` | `claude/agents/reviewer-docs.md` | `training/agents/reviewer-docs/` |

If the definition file is missing, **stop and report the error**. Do not proceed.

## Phase 2 — Eval Setup

- **No `.md` eval files exist** in `training/<type>/<name>/` (excluding `.autoresearch/`): auto-generate 3–5 starter eval cases from the definition. Display them to the user. **Wait for approval/edits before continuing.**
- **Evals already exist**: load all `.md` files from `training/<type>/<name>/` (excluding `.autoresearch/`). Report count to user.

### Eval file format

Plain markdown, no frontmatter:

```markdown
## Scenario
[Input context]

## Expected Behavior
[What the skill/agent should do]

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1 (binary yes/no)
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

## Phase 3 — Baseline

1. Read the current definition file.
2. For each eval file, simulate the scenario against the current definition: mark each pass criterion ✓ (pass) or ✗ (fail).
3. Score = criteria passed / total criteria across all evals.
4. Write initial state to `training/<type>/<name>/.autoresearch/state.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "iteration": 0,
     "baseline_score": <score>,
     "best_score": <score>,
     "cycles_without_improvement": 0
   }
   ```
5. Copy current definition to `training/<type>/<name>/.autoresearch/best.md`.
6. Report baseline score to user.

## Phase 4 — Autoresearch Loop

**Each cycle:**

1. Load state from `training/<type>/<name>/.autoresearch/state.json`. **Never trust memory — always read from disk.**
2. Load all eval files from `training/<type>/<name>/` (excluding `.autoresearch/`).
3. Read `training/<type>/<name>/.autoresearch/best.md` as the starting point.
4. Apply one mutation operator to produce a candidate definition (hold in memory — do not write to the live file):

   | Operator | When to use |
   |----------|-------------|
   | `add-constraint` | A rule that prevents an observed failure |
   | `add-example` | A concrete correct-behavior example |
   | `tighten-language` | Replace ambiguous wording with precise instructions |
   | `restructure` | Reorder steps/sections for clearer execution |
   | `add-negative-example` | Explicit "do NOT do X" case |
   | `remove-bloat` | Trim contradictory or redundant instructions |

   Select the operator based on failure patterns from the previous cycle. On cycle 1, analyse baseline eval results to choose.

5. Evaluate the candidate: for each eval, mark each pass criterion ✓/✗.
6. Score the candidate: criteria passed / total criteria.
7. Compare candidate score against `best_score` from `state.json`:
   - **Score improved**: overwrite `best.md` with candidate, update `best_score`, reset `cycles_without_improvement` to 0. Mark as **kept**.
   - **Score did not improve**: discard candidate, increment `cycles_without_improvement`. Mark as **reverted**.
   - **The live definition file is NEVER modified during the loop.**
8. Append to `training/<type>/<name>/.autoresearch/results.jsonl`:
   ```
   {"iteration": N, "score": X.XX, "best_score": X.XX, "operator": "add-constraint", "kept": true/false, "failed_criteria": ["criterion text", ...]}
   ```
9. Increment `iteration` in `state.json`.
10. **Human gate** — pause if any condition is met:
    - Score has reached 1.0 - i.e. no further improvement to be made against current set of evals
    - Every 5 cycles completed
    - 3 consecutive cycles with no improvement (`cycles_without_improvement >= 3`)

    Show summary table:
    ```
    | Cycle | Score | Operator       | Kept? |
    |-------|-------|----------------|-------|
    | 1     | 0.72  | add-constraint | ✓     |
    ```
    Ask: **continue** (run N more cycles), **stop**, or **adjust** (user edits evals or gives guidance).

## Phase 5 — Completion

Report: baseline score → best score, total cycles run, mutations kept vs reverted. Show a diff of `best.md` against the original live definition (which was never modified).

## Phase 6 — Apply (optional)

Ask: "Overwrite `<definition file path>` with the best candidate from this run?"

- **Yes**: write `best.md` → the live definition file.
- **No**: leave the original intact. Inform the user they can apply it manually.

**Never auto-apply without explicit user approval.**

## State Files

All files are gitignored via `training/.gitignore`:

```
training/<type>/<name>/.autoresearch/
├── state.json      ← iteration, best score, cycles-without-improvement
├── best.md         ← best-scoring candidate seen so far
└── results.jsonl   ← one entry per cycle
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Modifying the live definition during the loop** — the loop only ever writes to `.autoresearch/best.md`.
- **Trusting in-memory state** — always read `state.json` from disk at the start of each cycle.
- **Evaluating the live definition during the loop** — always evaluate candidates against `best.md`.
- **Auto-applying the best candidate** — Phase 6 requires explicit user approval.
- **Skipping the human gate** — pause at every 5 cycles and at 3 consecutive cycles without improvement.

## Eval

- [ ] Resolved definition path and evals directory correctly for both skill and agent inputs
- [ ] Stopped and reported error when definition file was missing
- [ ] Auto-generated starter evals and waited for user approval when no evals existed
- [ ] Wrote `state.json` with correct initial values before starting the loop
- [ ] Copied the current definition to `best.md` before the first cycle
- [ ] Read `state.json` from disk at the start of each cycle (not from memory)
- [ ] Evaluated candidates against `best.md`, not the live definition file
- [ ] Never wrote to the live definition file during the loop
- [ ] Appended a JSONL entry to `results.jsonl` after each cycle
- [ ] Paused at the human gate every 5 cycles or when `cycles_without_improvement >= 3`
- [ ] Asked for explicit user approval before overwriting the live definition in Phase 6
